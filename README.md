# odin-landing-page

This is the second actual project that I've done through The Odin Project. Essentially, I'm to create a full-on web page (without the javascript, obviously, not at that stage yet) using the knowledge I've gained thus far with my genius-level intellect.

I expect to need to look up tons of things, not trying to do this just with the stuff that's in my head. Because there's not much there. Lots of empty space, though.

It's taken me a lot longer to work my way through this foundations course than I thought it would, but I'm sticking with it, and it's been incredibly helpful thus far. Hopefully this project will go smooothly.

I'm writing this readme so I can reflect back on it after I've finished the project. Will be adding some post-mortem thoughts once it's completed.
