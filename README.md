# odin-landing-page

This is the second actual project that I've done through The Odin Project. Essentially, I'm to create a full-on web page (without the javascript, obviously, not at that stage yet) using the knowledge I've gained thus far with my genius-level intellect.

I expect to need to look up tons of things, not trying to do this just with the stuff that's in my head. Because there's not much there. Lots of empty space, though.

It's taken me a lot longer to work my way through this foundations course than I thought it would, but I'm sticking with it, and it's been incredibly helpful thus far. Hopefully this project will go smooothly.

I'm writing this readme so I can reflect back on it after I've finished the project. Will be adding some post-mortem thoughts once it's completed.

POST-MORTEM THOUGHTS:

This project was definitely the most difficult thing I've done in Foundations thus far. It took me almost ten hours of work to get it to the point that it's at now - and I think may still have a few minor issues. But, I don't think that the point of the assignment was to have something perfect.

I definitely need to work on cleaning up my code/avoiding unnecessary lines that could be accomplished in far fewer. For instance, I could've just made a container over the entire document, inside the body, and applied display: flex to it, and set the flex-direction to column for the whole thing. Then I wouldn't have had to change the direction on anything else since it's already set. Plus, I don't know if all the flex-direction changes that I did helped or maybe hindered/interacted weirdly with other elements.

I also seem to still forget the parent/child relationship in CSS. I thnk it'll still be a minute before I have the cascade system fully internalized. It's weird - I understand it but at the same time I don't? I guess it's the in-theory/in-practice conundrum that one runs into with any subject.

There were a few problems that I really struggled to get answers to, even with Google searches, and I did end up looking at a solution to learn how to fix them. Turns out I was stressing over partially nothing. One of the problems was that the hero/image wouldn't flex to still look perfect when the window was made as small as it could be, but that's impossible anyway, unless the size of the image is made able to shrink.

I also had a hard time with getting the "author" portion of the quote to align with the right side of the container. It sounds stupid easy, but I just couldn't get it. I knew that I needed to change the size of the flex container to be at the edge of the quote, but for some reason I couldn't get that done. It was a pretty simple fix, I just didn't consider adjusting the padding I guess.

Like I've thought before, I think the hardest part of CSS is understanding the cascade and what affects what, and where to put items in the cascade. It's something that may take a while still to fully internalize.

I am happy, mostly, with how I did the HTML. That is proving to be the easier part to understand at least.

All in all, I'm glad to be moving forward in the course now, but I think that I could've done this a bit better in some areas. Maybe I'll come back to it later and tweak some more things to really get it up to par.
